Ideas and issues all to do with my coding live stream

## Stream Notes
I caught part of a [roberttables](https://www.twitch.tv/roberttables) stream and he was doing stream notes, I thought it was an excellent idea so I retrospectively went back and did one for my stream earlier, I'll be doing that going forward, kudos to bobby tables.
