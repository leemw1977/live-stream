# Stream notes 29 January, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Who the heck am I, and Why leave gaming streaming for coding?
- [ ] Stream Updates

## Things we learned
Audio quality is bad using my current headset

I enjoyed streaming :)

-

## Notes
Really not happy with camera quality or background

I think background would be the easiest to solve e.g. a green sheet hung up behind me?

-

## Goals

- [x] Setup live stream github repo to keep track of things

- [x] Retrospectively write some stream notes (yeah an item on the list just so I can tick it off)


## Next Steps

Start using these Stream note documents (thank roberttables for the idea!)

Ideas for stream - formalise where I can keep these ideas
